Procedurally Engineered Temporal-Rhythmic Intercommunication

### Robots making a language by themselves
The ultimate goal of this project is to procure a non-deterministically generated language by allowing robots to interact in an environment with incentives to develop audio-based communication. After generations of language development, an etymology will be produced that is studiable. Humans will be able to learn the simplistic language and even speak with the robots in their artificially-conceived native tongue.
