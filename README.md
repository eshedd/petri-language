Procedurally Engineered Temporal-Rhythmic Intercommunication


### Robots making a language by themselves
The ultimate goal of this project is to procure a non-deterministically generated language by allowing robots to interact in an environment with incentives to develop audio-based communication. After generations of language development, an etymology will be produced that is studiable. Humans will be able to learn the simplistic language and even speak with the robots in their artificially-conceived native tongue.

### Usage
<!-- - Start the server -->
<!-- - ```python3 server.py [optional port for http server]``` -->
<!-- - Open `http://localhost:[port]/Pink-Trombone` to connect the m̶͖̪̲̠̗̞̓̊ȯ̷͈͆u̷̢̪̙̬͇̽ť̸̛̤͈̈͑́͝͝h̸̦͛̈͐̿̏ -->
<!-- - Put Paul (and Dave and everyone else) on their Journey with ```python3 main.py``` -->
Run `python3 main.py 5 5` to generate a 5x5 grid world.
